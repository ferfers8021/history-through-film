# History Through Film

A collection of lesson plans for teaching history using popular films. This repository serves as a version-controlled archive of teaching materials that can be easily shared, updated, and expanded over time.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide educators with ready-to-use lesson plans that leverage popular films as teaching tools. Each lesson plan is designed to help students analyze historical events, understand cinematic portrayals, and develop critical thinking skills by comparing film narratives with historical records.

## Repository Structure

Each lesson plan is stored in a directory named after the historical period or theme (e.g., `roman-empire/`, `cold-war/`, `world-war-ii/`). Inside each directory, you'll find one or more Markdown files named after the film (e.g., `gladiator-lesson-plan.md`).

### Lesson Plan Format

Every lesson plan includes the following sections:

1. **Historical Context** – A brief overview of the actual historical events, figures, and societal conditions relevant to the film.
2. **Film's Portrayal** – An analysis of how the film depicts those events and characters, focusing on narrative choices, character development, and visual style.
3. **Key Inaccuracies** – A list of significant historical liberties, anachronisms, or distortions taken by the filmmakers, with explanations of why they might have been made.
4. **Discussion Questions** – A set of 5–7 questions designed to stimulate classroom debate, critical analysis, and deeper exploration of the historical themes.
5. **Additional Resources** – Suggested readings, documentaries, primary sources, or other media for further study.

## Historical Periods Covered
